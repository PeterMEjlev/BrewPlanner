- ## Look for security issues

- ## Add support for
  - Electricity (Watt) usage
  - Water usage 
  - Temperature of fermentor (another Inkbird 308)
  - Temperature of brewery (another Inkbird 308)
  - Gravity of beer/wort fermentation (Tilt gravity sensor.) Tilt broadcasts BLE/iBeacon data.

- ## Improve phone layout for dashboard (make a phone specific layout? (so we have rpi (kiosk, desktop and phone specific layouts)))?

- ## Enable Keg inventory editing: 
  On the Raspberry Pi (production — the real deployment):
  
  The server runs as the checklist-server systemd unit, which reads secrets from /etc/brewplanner.env. SSH into the Pi, then:
  sudo nano /etc/brewplanner.env

  Add this line, save (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X):
    KEG_SHEET_WRITE_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxKTibop5YCnFjuewJLn-cf0MJ-o2SFVVqMzHm3BK-bp7fWmT9bECyZF5NF5uw4A-ywtA/exec

  Then restart the server:
    sudo systemctl restart checklist-server.service


- ## Incorporate the readings from the TILT hydrometer to log to brewersfriend. "The Tilt wireless hydrometer operates on bluetooth. Log readings from the phone app or using a Raspberry pi with this Cloud URL. Turn on Tilt integration in your brew session under the Fermentation tab to start collecting temperature and gravity readings. 
  Cloud URL: https://log.brewersfriend.com/tilt/5a2c07e701f38d2c83ff2289df53f598c927129f"
